# Welcome to the course

## Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is for you to learn to create basic unit tests and to become familiar with programming in
Python. In this course we will be using Pytest to test our code. If you have never written a unit test or don't
understand what they are don't worry after this unit you will be on your way to becoming a pro.

### Assignment Requirements

1. Create 4 functions respectivly for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
2. Create one unit test for each arithmetic function to verify that each function works correctly and put them in the
   respective test files in the tests folder.
3. Create an additional unit test for division that tests for the divide by zero exception to be thrown

1. [Automated Testing at Google Case Study - Must read](https://itrevolution.com/case-study-automated-testing-google/)
2. [AAA Testing - Must Read](https://automationpanda.com/2020/07/07/arrange-act-assert-a-pattern-for-writing-good-tests/)
3. [Pytest Overview](https://realpython.com/pytest-python-testing/)

### Prerequisite Knowledge

Note:  A basic understanding of programming.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. Open Pycharm Pro / Pycharm Community and clone the assignment repository. Open up a terminal in Pycharm, run "pip
   install -r
   requirements.txt" and then run "pytest".  **If pycharm shows you an error about pip / requirements when you clone the
   repo just skip/cancel/dismiss the error and run the command in the terminal like I said above**
2. You will need to complete the requirements for the assignment and remove/replace the tests that are meant to fail
   that I
   placed in each file.
3. When your pytest passes just commit and push it back to the origin and the assignment will be graded automatically by
   GitHub running the test that you run locally.
4. Check that your tests pass on GitHub after you push the assignment and then submit a link to your repository to the
   assignment in Canvas. Click the actions tab on GitHub to see your tests run. You will need to click on the
   autograding workflow to inspect that screen to see the detail test results.
